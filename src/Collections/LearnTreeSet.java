    /*
        Comparable : This is the interface which has compareTo method
        For Natural Order Sorting , the class must implement the interface comparable which has compareTo method.

        Comparable interface : comparable interface belongs to java.lang package

        interface Comparable {
            int compareTo(Object obj);
        }

        o1.compareTo(o2);
        Returns negative value if o1<o2;
        Returns positive value if o1>o2;
        Returns 0 if o1 and o2 are equal;


        Values in tree are printed on the basis of in order traversal

        Comparator is used for custom sorting order.
        It is present in java.util package
        It has two methods : compare(Object ob1, Object ob2), equals())

        int compare(Object ob1, Object ob2) :
            Returns negative if ob1 < ob2;
            Returns positive if ob1 > ob2;
            Returns zero if ob1 and ob2 are equal;

        boolean equals() :
            dummy method implementation is optional.
